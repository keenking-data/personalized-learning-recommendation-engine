# personalized-learning-recommendation-engine
This notebook builds a recommendation system for online courses by combining EdX and Udemy datasets. Weâ€™ll clean the data, create features, and build a hybrid recommendation system using content-based filtering  and knowledge-based filtering.
The goal is to recommend relevant courses (e.g., Web Development, Data Science).
This system will suggest courses that match your interests, skill level, and budget.
